            <p style="font-size: 18px;line-height: 30px;">Hi! I'm Ajjay Adhithya V. I was born in Chidambaram, a town in Cuddalore district. I spent my childhood in the lively city of Chennai. I did my schooling in Velammal Vidyalaya, where I not only gained a lot of knowledge but also a keen interest in learning about other topics. This school really shaped how I think and learn.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;line-height: 30px;">Currently, I am a Pre-Final Year student at Vellore Institute of Technology in Chennai, studying Computer Science Engineering. I am very passionate about coding and software development. For me, these are not just subjects to study but ways to solve problems and create innovative solutions. Apart from academics, I have a deep love for traveling. Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures has always been a big part of my life. It helps me stay curious and open-minded. In summary, my journey from school to college has been about learning, growing, and following my passions, both in technology and in exploring the world.</p>

                                <p>This paper proposes an intelligent Road Surface Quality Rating (RQR) System that uses real-time data from multiple sensors to evaluate and rate road conditions. The system assigns quality scores to different road segments, enabling better monitoring, proactive maintenance planning, and optimized route selection. It also integrates hazard alert notifications, ensuring enhanced road user safety through GIS-enabled platforms. By shifting from reactive to proactive infrastructure management, the system improves transportation resilience, resource efficiency, and travel reliability.</p>

                                    An AI-powered system to predict the trending potential of YouTube videos based on their title, description, and tags. 
                                    The project leverages NLP-based text cleaning, TF-IDF feature extraction, and multiple machine learning models 
                                    (Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting) to estimate the probability of a video trending. 
                                    It also provides actionable recommendations to improve video visibility, such as optimizing titles, descriptions, and tags. 
                                    The solution includes easy-to-use Jupyter notebooks for training and testing, making it practical for creators

                    <p>On 12th January 2025, I had the privilege of participating in üåü Kadal Karai - Season 2, Episode 1, a beach cleanup drive organized by the Rotaract Club of VIT Chennai and supported by the Rotary Club of Chennai.

                    <p>üèñÔ∏è Held at Elliot‚Äôs Beach (near Ashtalakshmi Temple) from 6:45 AM to 9:00 AM, the event gathered enthusiastic day scholars united by a shared mission to make a positive environmental impact. We worked together to remove litter, ensuring the beach was left cleaner and safer for both visitors and marine life. The effort highlighted the importance of community participation in preserving natural spaces.

                    <br>
                    <p>During the cleanup, we worked collectively to remove litter and debris scattered across the beach, ensuring the area was left cleaner, more presentable, and safer for visitors and marine life alike. The effort was not only about cleaning up but also about spreading awareness of the growing importance of protecting natural spaces and taking responsibility for environmental sustainability.

                    <p>On February 2nd, 2025, I had the privilege of participating in the 3rd Edition of the K10K Cancer Awareness Run held at Olcott Memorial School, Besant Nagar, Chennai, alongside my friend Allen. This event was not just a run‚Äîit was a heartfelt movement to spread awareness about cancer and to raise funds for treatments for the underprivileged.

                    <p>Cancer affects countless lives, and early detection is crucial for survival. Events like this emphasize the importance of timely diagnosis and the collective responsibility we all share in fighting this disease. Whether it was the 5K or 10K, every step taken that day was a step towards hope and change.
